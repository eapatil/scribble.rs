Scribble.rs is an alternative to the web-based drawing game skribbl.io. My main
problems with skribbl.io were the ads and the fact that a disconnect would
cause you to lose your points. On top of that, the automatic word choice was
quite annoying and caused some frustration.

The site will not display any ads or share any data with third parties.


### Hosting your own instance for free

By using Heroku, you can deploy a temporary container that runs scribble.rs.
The container will not have any cost and automatically suspend as soon as it
stops receiving traffic for a while.

Simply create an account at https://id.heroku.com/login and then click this link:
