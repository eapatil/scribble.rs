<h1 align="center">Scribble.rs</h1>

Scribble.rs is an alternative to the web-based drawing game skribbl.io. My main
problems with skribbl.io were the ads and the fact that a disconnect would
cause you to lose your points. On top of that, the automatic word choice was
quite annoying and caused some frustration.
